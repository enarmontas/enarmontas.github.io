My name is Ernestas.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I love technology, automating things, building scalable and reliable systems. I am driven by that feeling when "it just works" after hitting the return key.

Currently I am working as Site Reliability Engineer at [Vinted](https://vinted.com), previously worked as System Administrator at [Wix](https://wix.com).

In this blog, I am sharing my opinion and experiences about personal and work projects.
