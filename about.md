My name is **Ernestas**
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I am the guy, which „works something with computers“, „hacks everything“ or just another classic geek.
I am always interested in using technology to make something interesting or just have fun playing with it.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Here I am sharing experiences about personal and work projects.
Topics may include system and network administration, system engineering, programming and other IT related stuff.
