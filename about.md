My name is **Ernestas**
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I am the guy, which „works something with computers“, „hacks everything“ or just another classic geek.
I am always interested in using technology to make something interesting or just have fun playing with it.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Currently I am working as Site Reliability Engineer at [Vinted](https://vinted.com), previously as System Administrator at [Wix](https://wix.com).

In this blog, I am sharing my opinion and experiences about personal and work projects.
Topics may include system administration and engineering, programming and other IT related stuff.
